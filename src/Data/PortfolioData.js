      "One of the two 2D games I've made during my summer internship in 2020. The game design was deriving from the Chinese traditional festival - Ghost Festival (Zhongyuan Jie). In mid-summer, people in Taiwan believe that the gate of a temple will be opened. Thus, lots of spirits and ghosts will come out of the gate to the space we live in. In this game, the player controls a zombie who is on his way to the gate of the human world. The zombie needs to dodge obstacles and absorb spirits to defend attacks from Daoshi in order to survive to the gate.",
